# Preamble

One cliché we often hear is that 

`“There is always a choice” `

But the question ultimately boils down to: 

`"Are you willing to make the change? Even when it is you who is fighting the change?"`

We are all creatures of habit. Our results are dependent on those acts that we repeatedly do. Unfortunately our society measures our results in terms of wealth, attractiveness, social media followers, likes, comments... These metrics reflect your outward appearance and rewards those who manage to build an image that is *outwardly attractive*. 

But the rewarding of an *outwardly attractive* image overlooks the daily habits & choices we must make each time we wake up. There is no immediate reward for choosing to do your [daily pushups](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1368725/how-to-live-longer-push-ups-lower-risk-heart-disease-boost-longevity).

It is **YOU** who chooses your dumbbells, even if you know they will pose new challenges everytime more weight is added. 

It is **YOU** who chooses to avoid soda, or to ignore the temptations and cravings to take in more carbs before bed (especially when everyone around you is enjoying it).

It is **YOU** who chooses to binge watch instead of sleeping early, knowing full well the nagging headache you will give yourself tomorrow due to lack of sleep. 

Life is full of difficult choices, often it becomes more difficult keeping good habits when the stress piles on. But these habits & choices, they reinforce each other. It is we who determine where we ultimately want to go, which choices we think are best, and whether to maintain the habits that we **KNOW** will get us to the rewards we seek for ourselves.

In our ongoing battles with difficult choices and thankless habits, it's helpful to remember the wisdom of Aristotle when he said: 

`“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act, but a habit”`

 Centuries old saying, but certainly no cliché.

 Tuloy tuloy lang,

# Should learn to live with it...But I don't want to!

When Chicago, the 'Rock band with horns', released their acclaimed album 'Chicago 17'.  They said in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpuwWBHCjSo):

`Each album is just a spontaneous documentation of where the band is at at that particular time`

Let's all try to remember that despite all attempts at habits, goals & plans, at the end of the day, inspiration can't be forced.
