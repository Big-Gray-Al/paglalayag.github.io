“Happiness is when what you think, say, and do are in harmony” -Gandhi


# Preamble
“THE STRANGEST SECRET” is a classic book written by one of my favorite authors, Earl Nightingale. He was a man described as hungry for knowledge and would frequent libraries to search for answers to some of the questions that he would reflect on. 
Among many things he pondered on, the main theme he would dwell on would be about success. 
   
    “We live today in a golden age.
     This is an era that humanity has looked forward to, 
     dreamed of, 
     and worked toward for thousands of years. 
     We live in the richest era that ever existed
     on the face of the earth”

He goes on with this powerful definition of success: 

    “Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.”

In this edition of Paglalayag, we present to you articles that we hope inspires you to keep pursuing your purpose, your passion, your dreams. You had that early realization of what you aspired to be. Now we are in this stage in our lives, daunting it maybe because of all the challenges, but still a stage where all the reasons are there for us to move forward, enable are thoughts, actions and words to move in that one direction. Which is the fulfillment of what you define as a worthy ideal. 

Remember that in all of this, success is just one of the many results of being happy in everything you do. Happiness in Paglalayag!

 

# HAPPINESS

How can we achieve that which we all long for, contentment and happiness? Though these innate desire comes in several forms, unique to each one, there seems to be specific ingredients you can use to savor these two:

# WRITING

“Even if it takes a long time to achieve your aspiration; if it’s something you want, keep going. Take a chance on your dreams and make the most of the opportunities available to you or create an opportunity for you to achieve your dreams.”

# HEALTH

“A hidden tribe, super athletes, and the greatest race the world has never seen.”

[Born to Run](https://www.chrismcdougall.com/born-to-run/) talks about the science of running and how recent decades have taught scientists that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong. 

As the author uncovers the secrets of the tribe, he also discovers his own latent talents, something each of us has been gifted, of varying degrees. 


Speaking of Born to Run, I do believe Springsteen had something to say about that.
