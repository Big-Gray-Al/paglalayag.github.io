# How Hard is Change Really?

Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they’re finished. ~ Daniel Gilbert

Personal growth is about change. And change is hard, right?

Well, yes … and no.

The truth is, we’re all changing constantly, even now at midlife (and much more than we think). But this doesn’t mean we’re necessarily changing in the ways we want to.

So what is it that drives us to change in the ways we desire? I took on that topic this week as a Further Feature:

## Story of My Life

Now that you know [you’re a story](https://further.net/your-story/), how does that story change as you get older? Read up on narrative identity and autobiographical reasoning to find out why you’re right on the cusp of telling yourself a more positive story about your past, just in time for the [happiness curve](https://amzn.to/3fYCsqP) to kick in around age 50.

## Young Blood

For some of us (raises hand), we’ll need all the time we can get to get our story right. That could be okay, because new developments in life extension therapies continue to move closer to reversing aging and combating the life-ending diseases that come with it.

## Jump Up and Get Down

Until we get that scientific fountain of youth, there’s still the next best thing — exercise. Since my son is doing off-season training for basketball at home, we invested in a [plyometric box](https://amzn.to/3fW54Rn). Turns out his old man still has some spring in his legs (some being the key word).
