# Dissecting a market failure in a Rally creator coin

Please check out my full report here:
[A Move Coin Moment](/assets/pdf/move-coin-moment.pdf)

# Some extra background

I was a hesistant, late-entrant into the crypto/Web3 space primarily because of the energy intensity of Proof-of-Work.  

While Ethereum has not yet completed its full transition over to proof of stake, I continue to follow their developments with interest.  As a devops practitioner, I can only imagine the kinds of challenges they face in this migration.

In the meantime, I've enjoyed getting cozy with a couple online communities in the web3 space.  

$MOVE is a token hosted on the [Rally](https://rally.io) network.  As enthusiasts and new entrants into the space, we didn't really know what to expect.  The Creators have built much of their business success as early adopters of new technologies & approaches as they emerge in different pockets of the World Wide Web.

While much of their work is not made freely available.  I have found that they do a great job of presenting an open book about their trials & tribulations, their hits, balls and strikes from the leading edge.
