# Lift Yourself Up

I’m no fan of the gym, so strength training these days is of the bodyweight variety. In this do-anywhere, bodyweight workout, you’ll push hard for 20 minutes to create core stability, open up tight hips, and get a much-needed cardio benefit that’s way more effective than jogging.

# Stretch Armstrong

If you’re exercising to lose weight, be well, and improve mood, you should be stretching. It will help with muscle remodeling, connective tissue strengthening, range-of-motion improvement, joint alignment, and potentially blood flow during subsequent exercise.

# Automatic Leadership

Have you ever wondered what separates the good leaders from the great? It’s not raw, natural talent or innate skill. No, it’s something more impactful and difficult to master — changing basic habits.

# Withdrawal Symptoms

You want to create a spending plan, but you don’t want to make an intricately detailed line-item budget or budgeting worksheet. Consider creating a budget presented in five categories that represents a “broad overview.”

# Stay the Course

When the going gets tough in the market, people invested in stocks have the natural impulse to pull out to cut their losses. By using an income allocation plan instead, you can ride out downturns more confidently.

# The Motivated Brain

Instead of wishing for motivation or hunting for more motivation, think about the different types of motivators we experience, and what’s going on in our brains when we experience them.

# Through the Looking Glass

We form our beliefs based on what comes to us from the world through the window of perception, but then those beliefs act like a lens, focusing on what they want to see. That doesn’t bode well for the idea that policy or other debates can be solved by simply giving people accurate information.
