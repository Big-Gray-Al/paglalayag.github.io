"The climb might be tough and challenging but the view is worth it" - Victoria Arlen

When you were younger, what did you think your current age would be like?

I’m not sure I thought about it at all, but I don’t think I thought I would be this … I don’t know, vibrant.

A lot of things annoy me right now (gestures broadly at everything). And yet, I’ve got more joie de vivre at age 53 than I did in my 20s.

Maybe that’s because I was a basket case in my 20s. But it’s more than that. Despite the many myths about getting older, this is pretty damn good.

As for those myths, maybe it’s time to bust them once and for all. Here are some straight facts about popular midlife myths:

# 1. The “Crisis”

There’s no doubt that your 40s can be tough, with [peak dissatisfaction arriving at 47.2](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/happiness-hits-rock-bottom-at-age-47-2-according-to-new-research.html) (weirdly specific). But it’s more likely to be a vague transitional unhappiness rather than a full-blown crisis. Still though, better to stay away from Corvette dealerships until you’re safely 50.

# 2. Sex is Over

Loss of desire can be an issue as we get older due to physical changes, especially if your long-term relationship is [lacking in sexual novelty](https://www.sutterhealth.org/health/sexual-health-relationships/great-sex-in-midlife). On the other hand, roughly 38 percent of 40-year-olds and 19% of 50-64 year-olds use dating apps. And all the single people I know that are my age are telling tales of activities that almost make me blush. Get creative!

# 3. Your Work Life has Peaked

You may be at the peak of your powers, but that just means it’s time to put them to newer uses. Midlifers are ditching stale careers for side hustles and hobbies that become full-time businesses. People aged 40-65 are putting their experience and networks to work in [entrepreneurial ventures](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/four-secrets-to-success-as-a-midlife-entrepreneur/).

# 4. Death is at the Door

Once you get through the initial doldrums, midlife really does become your best life. You’re driven by [meaning and purpose](https://www.wsj.com/articles/i-refocused-on-living-a-life-with-purpose-readers-share-their-stories-of-midlife-crisis-11579708284) rather than social status or material acquisition, and you’re confident enough to want to give back while continuing to challenge yourself. And if you take care of yourself, you’ve likely got a long road ahead of you to thrive.
