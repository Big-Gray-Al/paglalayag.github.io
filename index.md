# In Paglalayag, the winds are always changing. How will you navigate to your destination?

I'm Allan and I started Paglalayag with my buddy Mic. 

We're each on our own journeys towards financial independence. Paglalayag is still a side project but we each have some unique resources available to us to help you in your journey to create the lifestyle you want when it's time for you to come home. 

Whether you hope to one day:

{% include highlight.html text=
"- Build a comfortable lifestyle for you and your family"
%}
{% include highlight.html text=
"- Improve the lives of those around you"
%}
{% include highlight.html text=
"- Leave a lasting legacy"
%}

Rest assured, there will be many challenges and opportunities ahead of you, and you will be faced with many who didn't have the opportunity and exposure to the rest of the world. 

**Many will not understand what you seek to accomplish**

Ya, we get it.

The Philippines has lots of room for improvement but here's a little secret that you won't often hear in the news… Things have been improving!

In fact, a steady 7% GDP growth over the past decade has the World Bank anticipating the country graduating to upper-middle income in the coming years…

Paglalayag seeks to be a space for **seasoned and storied** Filipinos around the globe to provide thoughts on how the Philippines can best navigate towards this brave new world. 

We'll do this from a few angles:

# 1. Technology demonstrations
 For now, this is mainly the 2nd-gen [sunE](www.sunEtrike.com) Tech Demonstration, in co-ordination with Batangas State University *(waitlist link coming soon!)*

# 2. Emerging business models
 There are a number of innovations involved in the business model we are introducing via sunEtrike.  I've been around long enough to realize that this makes Filipinos nervous.
 At the same time, the world around us is changing:
 

{% include highlight.html text=
"- Smartphone usage increases year over year."
%}

{% include highlight.html text=
"- We are more connected than ever before."
%}

{% include highlight.html text=
"- More people are moving into cities & other urban areas."
%}

 So while sunE has a lot to offer the Filipino public & entrepreneurs, it has a larger barrier to entry than many other business opportunities out there and there are a lot of skills that are required fo business success.

 We are also active with:
     Solar Impulse
     IEEE Smart Cities

# 3. Stories from abroad and Filipiniana
 Everyone loves a good story and like Bilbo moving away from the shire, going abroad is a big scary adventure. In many ways, it is a wonderful growing experience.

 It can also be lonely, Paglalayag seeks to provide a space for kabayani to share some of these stories and keep a connection.

    Tuloy tuloy lang!
