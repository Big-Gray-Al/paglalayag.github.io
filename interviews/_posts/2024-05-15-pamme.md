I had the pleasure of chatting with Pam this weekend during the kickoff weekend of [New Energy Nexus](https://www.facebook.com/nexphilippines).

Her energy & passion for fashionable plastic waste products was wonderful to hear about and I look forward to following her progress over the next few months!
