As the in-house expert on climate & energy at New Energy Nexus, I was curious to know more about Ralph's background and story. 

I was pleasantly surprised to learn he'd come from his own startup several years ago.

Maybe one of these days he'll rekindle his *Need for Speed* and jump back into the startup arena ðŸ˜œ

Until then, I know that all of us in cohort 5 are grateful for the support from him and the rest of [New Energy Nexus Philippines](https://www.newenergynexus.com/programs/philippines/).

Please reach out to Ralph at the email mentioned at 33:50 if you are interested in attending the August 6 2-in-1 event which will feature: 
 - Launch of the 2024 New Energy Innovation Ecosystem Report,
 - Cohort 5 Demo Day
