Over the [New Energy Nexus](https://www.newenergynexus.com/) kickoff weekend, Ranielle & I sat down for a lunchtime deep dive into Battery Management Systems, patenting and design strategies.

This crew of students has a great pace going!  Just last weekend they won [UP's Student Startup Competition](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1941754/rise-rural-philippines-wins-in-qc-startup-student-competition)! Keep an eye on 'em!

We pushed our luck with the hotel so I didn't quite get to cover all the questions I was hoping to.  But I was glad to be able to talk first principles, it's a rare treat for me to talk so technical about batteries and electronics.
