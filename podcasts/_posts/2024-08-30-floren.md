Floren is an early-stage investor at Plug & Play ventures.  Since 2021, there has been considerable investor activity around the geothermal sector.  

This buzz prompted Floren to do a deep-dive into the state of geothermal tech and startups recently and when I heard about it, I couldn't resist the urge to hear what the VCs find new and exciting in the space.  

As my first foray into the world of energy, Geothermal resources hold a special place in my heart and it was a real treat having this conversation.
