In addition to the core services of:
  - `Custom Solar PV Systems`
  - `Energy Efficiency Audit`
  - `Ongoing Maintenance & Monitoring Support`

They are also providing
  - `Flexible Financing plans`
  - `Comprehensive Insurance`


SPARC's also has an impact arm focused on extending out into underserved communities with:

 - `Community-Based Solar Projects` for livelihood integration into communities that cannot access traditional solar financing.

 - `Capacity Building` trainings for local community members in solar system maintenance and basic troubleshooting.

 - `Education and Awareness` workshops to promote renewable energy adoption and environmental consciousness.

 - `Collaborative Partnerships` with local governments, NGOs, and community organizations to identify and address energy needs in remote areas.

 - `Sustainable Development` to improve economic resilience for education & healthcare facilities.

Through this integrated approach, SPARC is making big steps to build energy independence and resilience for the rural communities they serve and I'll be looking forward to following their progress.
