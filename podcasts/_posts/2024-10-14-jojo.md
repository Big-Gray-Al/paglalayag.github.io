Since his start in the bottled water industry, Mr Jojo Flores has built [Plug & Play Ventures](https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/ventures/) into Silicon Valley's most active Venture Capital firm.

He also built up Launch Garage with [Jay Fajardo](/podcasts/2024/07/25/jay/) into one of the original startup ecosystem enablers which helped to build the scene into what it is today.

With a legacy like this, it's important to understand where Mr Flores sees the Philippines moving in today's market environment and many of his comments here will probably be seen as prescient a few years from now.

If you are doing tech development in/around the Philippines, this conversation is well worth your time.
