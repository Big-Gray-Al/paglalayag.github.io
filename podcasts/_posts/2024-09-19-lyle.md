Lyle Trytten is a fountain of knowledge regarding the core battery component we know as Nickel.

We sat down to talk shop about materials, the state of the art in processing techniques.

He has heaps of additional resources online and a great place to start is the stuff posted to his [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyle-trytten/)

*50:40 -* **CORRECTION** Australian nickel production is likely to drop by more than 60%, not go to near zero. IGO mines likely about 25-30 kt/y, Minara about 35 kt/y, so dropping from about 160 to 60-65 kt/y.
