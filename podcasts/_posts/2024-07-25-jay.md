I suspect the startup scene is going to see some very cool things coming out of Ideaspace & QBO in the next few years.

These days, the tools available for learning to code and build make it easier to 'bang something together' as Jay likes to say.

There are all sorts of personalities & styles that will succeed in entrepreneurship.  But Jay is one of those founders who carries special appreciation for the folks who get their hands dirty.
