[E-Trike Pangkabuhayan](https://www.facebook.com/etrike.pangkabuhayan) is a Cotabato City based Social Enterprise with the mission of converting the city's Sikads towards modernized, eco-friendly solar-charged electric tricycles.

Like many areas of the Philippines, Sikad operators (pedal-bike pedicabs) struggle to get ahead with the daily payments (boundary) they make operate their vehicles.

Since 2021, E-trike Pangkabuhayan has been offering a Rent-to-Own scheme to their beneficiaries giving them a path to wealth-building through asset ownership.

To further enable their ability to support their beneficiaries, they are now moving to also offer electric variants.  This is especially helpful to older beneficiaries, or those with disabilities.  Who may struggle to pedal all day for their daily rice.
