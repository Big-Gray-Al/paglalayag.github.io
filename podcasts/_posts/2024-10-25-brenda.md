Brenda has been a startup enabler for her entire career, and it shows.  The range of different startups and founders she's seen pass through the programs of first Ideaspace and now New Energy Nexus give her a very unique perspective when it comes to what it takes to not only build a tech startup, but also what is required to put the Filipino innovation ecosystem on solid foundation for energy startups.

As Brenda mentioned, the [New Energy Nexus](https://www.newenergynexus.com/) tagline '100% Clean Energy for 100% of the population', is very ambitious in both its reach and implications.

There isn't an obvious direct translation for *Inclusivity in Tagalog*. BUT, alongside the broader family of Filipino dialects, Tagalog features an interesting spin on inclusion/exclusion, which we discuss for a bit in this episode.
