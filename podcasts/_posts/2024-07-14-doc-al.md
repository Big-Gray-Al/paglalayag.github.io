Since returning to the Philippines in 2013 on the Balik Scientist program,  
Doc Al has been touring the country setting up & training Technology Transfer Offices. 

Then, in 2017 the USAID funded the [STRIDE program](https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MNH4.pdf) targetted at setting up Centres of Excellence across the country.

Doc Al is a fountain of information.  If you are building or considering to invest into hardware startups, you definitely want to listen to this.
