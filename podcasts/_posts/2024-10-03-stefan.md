Stefan's group [Ecolyte](https://ecolyte.at/) is working to scale up its Organic Flow battery using their own electrolyte derived from [industrial-grade vanillin](https://www.vanillaflow.eu/).

Stefan and I hit it off in HK during their visit late last year and so I was keen to get him on for as part of a few episodes focusing on battery materials and tech.

The running joke between us is that [Hessner's supercapacitors](hessner.tech) and small and fast, while his vanilla flow is more of a slow and plodding style of kung fu.  Perhaps like a [sloth](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/creation/NLTnPIy8MbdBifEgPEDY).
